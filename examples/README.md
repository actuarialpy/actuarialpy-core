# actuarialpy examples

Self-contained, runnable examples for the main surfaces of `actuarialpy`. Each
script generates its own small synthetic data (via `_sample_data.py`) and prints
a short report, so they run with nothing but the package installed:

```bash
pip install actuarialpy
python experience_basics.py
```

Every script is standalone — run any one directly, in any order.

**Start here:** [`renewal.py`](renewal.py) is the end-to-end study — it threads the
individual surfaces below into a single group renewal, from experience to indicated rate
change. The others each focus on one surface.

| Script | Surface | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| `renewal.py` | **end-to-end** | a full group renewal: complete → trend → relativities (`adjust`) → pool large claimants → credibility-blend with the manual → load → `indicated_change` |
| `experience_basics.py` | `Experience` facade, metrics | Bind roles once; `.by`, `.views`; metric primitives (`loss_ratio`, `pmpm`, `pure_premium`) |
| `claimant_concentration.py` | claimants, pooling | `claimant_concentration`, `top_claimants`, `large_claimant_flags`, `pool_losses`, `excess_over_threshold` |
| `reserving_ibnr.py` | reserving | `make_completion_triangle` → `completion_factors` → `apply_completion` → `ibnr`, per-line `completion_factors_by` + grouped `apply_completion(by=)`, and `develop_ultimate` (chain ladder vs Bornhuetter-Ferguson vs Benktander vs Cape Cod) |
| `seasonality.py` | seasonality | `business_days_in_period`, `seasonality_factors` → `deseasonalize`, plus per-line `seasonality_factors_by` + grouped `deseasonalize(by=)` |
| `restatement.py` | adjustments | `Experience.adjust` chain — scalar trend, per-region and per-line relativities, with a cumulative `audit_col` |
| `trend_and_forecast.py` | trend | `trend_summary`, `annualized_trend`, `project_forward`, `trend_factor`, and `fit_trend` (log-linear trend with diagnostics, fit on deseasonalized history) |
| `rolling_trend_monitor.py` | rolling, decomposition | a monthly change-in-trend monitor: each evaluation month compares the trailing-12 window to the same window a year earlier via `decompose_pmpm_trend`, reporting whether the year-over-year move is utilization- or unit-cost-driven |
| `trend_decomposition.py` | decomposition | `decompose_pmpm_trend` two-way (utilization × unit cost), and the three-way `mix_by=` split — adds a mix term via LMDI, reconciling exactly; single dimension, the cross of two, and `on=` + `mix_by=` together; plus the `Experience.decompose_trend` facade method (same split with columns bound once) |
| `credibility.py` | credibility | `credibility_weighted_estimate`, `Experience.credibility_weighted` |
| `lifecycle_and_banding.py` | lifecycle, banding | `derive_status`, `Experience.by_status`, `Experience.by_band` |

## The sample data

`_sample_data.py` (not part of the library) provides three deterministic generators:

- **`sample_member_months()`** — a member-month experience frame spanning
  2024–2025: claim components, rebates, non-FFS expense, premium, per-group
  effective/termination dates, and a subscriber count. A few members incur
  catastrophic claims so the concentration and pooling examples have a real tail.
- **`sample_claim_payments()`** — a long (line of business, origin, valuation,
  incremental-paid) frame for the reserving example, with a distinct payment
  pattern per line of business so the grouped completion join has something to
  separate; `make_completion_triangle` accumulates it into a cumulative triangle.
- **`sample_seasonal_panel()`** — a monthly claims panel by line of business and
  product over four years, with a real month-of-year seasonal pattern (one line
  swings hard, the other is mild), membership growth, and a cost trend, for the
  seasonality example.
- **`sample_trend_cells()`** — a deterministic two-period (2024/2025) claims panel
  split into morbidity-segment × region cells, with uniform within-cell utilization
  (+3%) and unit-cost (+4%) trend and an enrollment shift toward the High segment, so
  the book-wide two-way overstates both drivers and the mix term recovers the
  difference; carries `claim_count`, `allowed`, and `premium` so it drives both the
  free `decompose_pmpm_trend` and the `Experience.decompose_trend` facade method in the
  trend-decomposition example.

## Note

These mirror the worked examples shipped alongside the sibling packages
(`lossmodels`, `risksim`, `extremeloss`). For an end-to-end application that wires
all four packages together, see the high-cost-claimant cost-model project.
